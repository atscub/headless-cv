profile: |
  I’ve built software professionally for the last 13 years—from frontend and full-stack work to mobile apps and distributed systems. My journey includes creating an email-to-web bridge in Cuba when internet was scarce, and contributing open source tools that solve real problems (like a Python library with 41 stars).

  I mentor developers, advocate for clean code, and connect the dots between tech and business. I thrive on tackling tough problems, making things work, and making them last. Lately, I’m exploring how AI and multi-agent systems can change the way we build software.

  I care about impact, not just output.

      Own the whitelabel portal (**50k+ weekly users**), partner portal, traveler app, and several GraphQL-based BFFs serving **thousands of users** and **600k+ daily queries**.

      - Led the development of a dedicated admin portal for one of the largest European travel groups, using a state-of-the-art stack (Vite + React + TailwindCSS + TanStack), plus an embeddable vehicle-selection widget.
      - Led the redesign of the whitelabel application and implemented reactive A/B tests, increasing conversion by **~50%** and enabling rollout for **Agoda** (**~5k bookings/month**), one of the biggest names in the Asian travel space.
      - Optimized performance of the legacy whitelabel application, reducing load times by **~50%**. Built a custom GraphQL-prefetching layer to load data before React initialized—critical for launching the Agoda partnership (~5k bookings/month).
      - Advocates for and advances AI-augmented development practices. Examples include raising test coverage across apps to **80%+** and reducing discovery + refinement + development time by **~4×**.
      - Improved frontend type safety and reliability by implementing GraphQL schema–based type generation, reducing production bugs by **~80%**.
      - Developed tipping functionality (with a fellow frontend engineer and the CTO), enabling travelers to tip drivers directly within the app.

      - Implemented a JSON-based protocol to pack and unpack web requests and responses.
      - Built custom Java (Android) and .NET (Windows) client applications with low-level concurrency logic to handle many simultaneous web-page requests over a single email channel, achieving **~4-second round trips** per page—significantly faster than any other web-to-email solution at the time.

      A Python client for interacting with Cuba's Nauta internet service. Built to solve a real problem for Cuban users managing their internet accounts—checking balance, viewing usage history, and handling connections programmatically. The library abstracts away the complexity of the Nauta portal's authentication and session management, making it simple for developers to integrate these features into their own tools and applications.
